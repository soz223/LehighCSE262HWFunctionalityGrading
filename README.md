# README

## Overview
This code is designed to automate the process of checking multiple students’ GitLab repositories for certain criteria (such as required files, tests, or CI/CD results). It works by reading a list of participants from a file, constructing their repository URLs, and then invoking a separate `check_repo.py` script to analyze each repository.

It can evaluate students' work by reading the commit history and the CI/CD pipeline pass situation. It can download the project and  `cargo run` them to do the running locally in batch. To get started, please go to grading-hw2.ipynb. (since in 2024 Fall, the HW1 in CSE262 has no CI/CD pipeline yet while the HW2 and later HW did.)

The main idea is:
1. Read participant identifiers from `participants.txt`.
2. For each participant, form the appropriate GitLab repository URL.
3. Run `check_repo.py` against that repository.
4. If `check_repo.py` encounters an error, report it and continue with the next participant.

## Key Functional Steps

**1. Input (Participants List):**  
The code expects a `participants.txt` file, where each line corresponds to a participant’s username or email. From this input, the code:
- Reads all participant entries line-by-line.
- Removes trailing newlines to obtain clean participant identifiers.

**2. Constructing Repository URLs:**
Each participant is assumed to follow a consistent repository naming convention (e.g., `username-cse262/homework-1` on GitLab). The script constructs the repository URL by combining a GitLab base URL, the participant’s username, and a homework identifier.  
Example:  
`http://gitlab.cse.lehigh.edu/<username>-cse262/homework-1`

**3. External Analysis Script – `check_repo.py`:**
This file leverages `check_repo.py` to perform the heavy lifting. The `check_repo.py` script (not shown here in detail) presumably:
- Connects to GitLab using the provided URL and token.
- Checks the repository for required files.
- Counts tests.
- Validates CI/CD pipelines.
- Generates a results file.

From this script’s perspective, you only need to know that `check_repo.py` analyzes a given repository and exits with a non-zero code if something goes wrong.

**4. Error Handling and Continuous Execution:**
After calling `check_repo.py`, the script checks the returned status code:
- If `check_repo.py` fails, it prints an error message specific to that participant’s repository and moves on to the next one.
- If it succeeds, it prints the return code (typically `0` for success).

This ensures that one problematic repository does not halt the entire batch process.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare the Participants File:**  
   Create a file named `participants.txt` and list one participant (username or email prefix) per line. For example:  
   ```
   soz223
   abc123
   xyz789
   ...
   ```

2. **Adjust Homework Number (If Needed):**  
   In the code, the repository URL is hardcoded to `homework-1`. If you need to check a different homework assignment, update the URL part accordingly:
   ```python
   repo_url = f"http://gitlab.cse.lehigh.edu/{people}-cse262/homework-2"
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**  
   From the command line, simply run:
   ```bash
   python check_multiple_repos.py
   ```
   (Assuming the above code is saved in `check_multiple_repos.py`)

4. **Examine Output:**  
   The script will output the status for each participant. If `check_repo.py` encounters an error for a participant’s repository, you’ll see an error message. Otherwise, you’ll see a success indicator (return code `0`).

## Integration Notes

- Ensure `check_repo.py` is in the same directory or in the system’s PATH.
- Make sure that `check_repo.py` is configured correctly (e.g., GitLab URL, private token).
- Review the output files generated by `check_repo.py` (if any) for detailed results of each repository check. This might include test counts, CI/CD status, and required file presence.

By following the steps above, you can streamline the process of validating multiple students’ homework submissions against a standard set of repository requirements.
